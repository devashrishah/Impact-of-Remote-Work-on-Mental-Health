# Impact-of-Remote-Work-on-Mental-Health

## Introduction
This app dives deep into how a work location has influence on stress level and job satisfaction.
With many Fortune 500 companies and other small companies too have started calling their employees back in office. I was curious to find out how it affects employees work-life balance and mental health. As going back into office might require some people to relocate and also having high commute time and probably their might be other factors too. Through this app you can find out if working from home is more productive or on-site.

## Data Source
I got the data from Kaggle, which has about 5000 records from employees in varied regions worldwide. This dataset provides valuable insights into key areas like work location (remote, hybrid, onsite), stress levels, access to mental health resources, and job satisfaction. This dataset helps in assessing the growing influence of remote work on productivity and well-being.
